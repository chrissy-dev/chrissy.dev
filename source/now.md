## At work:
- Re-writing API endpoints for a new build of a mobile app.
- Building a UI to allow non-technical editors to scale servers ahead of traffic spikes.

## In life:
- Doing the [West Highland Way](https://www.westhighlandway.org/) in July/August.
- My son turned 2 ðŸŽ‰.

## For fun:
- Scanning a box of old film from 1950-80 that I was given by [Glasgow Loves Vintage](https://www.facebook.com/Glasgowlovesvintage/).
- Bought a new gravel bike, it's due to be delivered in Sept 2021.
- Launched [GravelScotland.com](https://www.gravelscotland.com/) - initial uptake has been good. Need to add more routes.
