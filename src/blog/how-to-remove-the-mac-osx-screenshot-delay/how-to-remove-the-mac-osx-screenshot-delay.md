Mac OS X version 10.14 came with a lot of improvements - one of which was the additional tooling to the screenshot app. 

A default feature of this new tooling was a displaying a small thumbnail for a few seconds in the lower right corner. The problem is that the system waits 5 seconds before the file is created. 

If you take a lot of screenshots the 5 second delay feels like an age. Luckily you can disable it. 

1. Hit `cmd` + `shift` + `5`
2. In the control bar that appears hit **"options"**
3. Uncheck "Show floating thumbnail"

Winner.
